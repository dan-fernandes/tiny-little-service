# tiny_little_service

A Tiny Little Service that does nothing.

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/dan-fernandes/tiny-little-service>
:---:           | :---:
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/dan-fernandes/tiny-little-service:latest`
Releases        | <https://github.com/dan-fernandes/tiny-little-service/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from tiny_little_service import __version__

print(f"Hello tiny_little_service {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m tiny_little_service --version
```
